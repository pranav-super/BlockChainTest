BlockChainTest - WIP!

This is a simple blockchain implementation using a (very rough) React Native client, an Express server, a Flask server, and a MySQL user database (ironic, I know). The coin implementation was based off of: https://medium.com/crypto-currently/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain-e70965a248b.

I am still in progress of updating the UI and making sure that everything works cohesively.
